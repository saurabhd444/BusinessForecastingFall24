#Outliers: There are no outliers in the data, as indicated by the absence of any outlier values.
#Conclusion:
#The data is positively skewed since the median (7246.265) is closer to the first quartile (2848.512) than the third quartile (14418.802).

#The autocorrelation gradually decrease, with a more noticeable drop after lag 1.41 where it reaches a value of 0.075, suggesting lack of short-term dependence(recent values do not provide much information about future values) after a few lags, the correlation weakens significantly.

#Seasonality / Cyclical Patterns:

#The relatively high autocorrelation at lag 0.8333 (about 9 months) compared to subsequent lags indicates potential seasonality or cyclical behavior, it suggests that  series may exhibit seasonal dependence or periodic trends or Annual Cycles.
#Analyzing seasonal decomposition   might be beneficial.

#Decomposition Summary
#The trend is the most significant contributor to the variation in the data
#There is significant seasonality in the data, with seasonal fluctuations ranging from -1631.1533 to 1805.6200, contributing to about 20.9% of the total variation
#Remainder: The residuals show a median close to zero, indicating that most of the variation in the time series has been captured by the seasonal and trend components
#which indicates that the model captures most of the variation in the time series, leaving only a small amount of unexplained noise.

#Given the fact that the seasonal component does not appear to vary proportionally with the trend, and the seasonal effects remain constant in size relative to the level of the data, it suggests that the time series is additive, not  multiplicative.

##   Initial states:

#An alpha of 0.4319 means that the model is assigning 43.19% weight to the most recent data point, while the remaining 56.81% is assigned to the historical average of the series. This indicates a relatively moderate weight on recent data, meaning the forecast is moderately influenced by the latest observation but still accounts for historical trends

#The initial state represents the starting level of the series, from which forecasts begin. It is derived from the early values of the time series and serves as the baseline level for forecasting. In this case, the initial level is 1472.029.

#A higher sigma value (2603.101) means that the errors or deviations from the forecasted values are relatively large, suggesting that there may be a significant amount of noise or variability in the data  which  ses failed to capture

## Smoothing parameters:
##  alpha: 0.1141222
##  beta : 1
##  gamma: 0.9895402
#A smaller alpha indicates that the model is less sensitive to recent changes, and more emphasis is placed on historical data.

#beta : 1 This indicates that the model assumes the trend is completely influenced by the most recent data, and it directly incorporates the latest change in the series' trend.
##  gamma: 0.9895402 This indicates that the model responds very strongly to recent seasonal patterns, updating based on the latest data. This suggests that the seasonal effect is highly adaptive to recent patterns in the data.

#MAE gives the average absolute difference between the actual and forecasted sales in the same units (dollars) as the original sales data.
accuracy(forecast_hw)
#MAE: 1679.95 indicates the forecast is off by around $1,680 on average.
accuracy(ses_forecast)
#MAE: 1608.26 is a bit smaller than the Holt-Winters MAE, but still quite large, meaning the SES model is off by around $1,608 on average.
accuracy(naive_forecast)
#MAE: 503.06 is the smallest MAE, meaning that on average, the model is off by just $503.06.
accuracy(forecast_MA3_forecast)
#MAE: 503.06 is the smallest MAE, meaning that on average, the model is off by just $503.06.

#In conclusion, for this time series, Moving Average (MA3) is the most accurate model, followed by Simple Exponential Smoothing and Holt-Winters. The Naive forecast is not a good fit for this dataset and should likely be avoided.
