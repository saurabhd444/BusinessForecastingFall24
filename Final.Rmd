# 3) Please summarize your observations of the time series plot

#The sharp decline and subsequent fluctuation in car sales during the first half of 2020 were primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

#Initial Decline was primary  due to 

#Lockdowns and Factory Shutdowns
#Economic Uncertainty
#Reduced Consumer Demand


#Subsequent Fluctuations are due to 

#Pent-Up Demand
#Supply Chain Disruptions
#Shifting Consumer Preferences

#sales started to follow Gradual Normalization in 1st/2nd quarter of 2022 hence only taking the limited data for our prediction 
#create new x axis quarters matching with data

# 4) Show a time series plot. 

#Plot Time series Graph of new data 
plot(ts_new, main = "Total Monthly car Sales ", xlab = "Month", ylab = "Sales", col = "blue", lwd = 2)

# 5) What are the min, max, mean, median, 1st, and 3rd Quartile values of the times series? 
#Show Min max ,Quartiles for time series



#Summary of Statistics:
#Minimum (Min.): 13.87
#1st Quartile (1st Qu.): 15.00
#Median: 15.73
#Mean: 15.48
#3rd Quartile (3rd Qu.): 16.19
#Maximum (Max.): 16.45

# 6) Show the box plot. 
#boxplot 
bp<-boxplot(ts_new)

# 7) Can you summarize your observation about the time series from the summary stats and box plot? 
print(bp)
#The box plot  shows:

#The box spanning from 15.00 (1st Qu.) to 16.19 (3rd Qu.) with a line at the median (15.73).
#Whiskers extending from the minimum value (13.87) to the maximum value (16.45).
#No outliers.
#The median (15.73) is slightly higher than the mean (15.48), indicating that the data might be slightly skewed to the left (since the mean is lower than the median).
#The range (Max - Min) is 16.45 - 13.87 = 2.58, indicating a relatively small spread in the data.
#The interquartile range (IQR, which is the difference between the 3rd quartile and the 1st quartile) is 16.19 - 15.00 = 1.19, showing the middle 50% of the data is concentrated within a narrow range.

#Decomposition

# 8) Plot the decomposition of the time series.

# Decompose the series using STL decomposition
sales_decomp <- stl(ts_new, s.window = "periodic")
plot(sales_decomp)
summary(sales_decomp)

# 9) Is the time series seasonal?

#Yes, the time series is seasonal,  the seasonal component explains a  portion of the overall variation (11.3%) and also see a pattern in the stl decomposed seasonal component


#10) Is the decomposition additive or multiplicative? 
#Based on the provided STL decomposition, the decomposition appears to be additive because:

#The seasonal and remainder components are represented as values that are added to the trend (rather than being multiplied by the trend).


#11) If seasonal, what are the values of the seasonal monthly indices? 
#Monthly seasonal indexes fluctuating and ranging from 0.4 to -0.4 

#12) For which month is the time series value high, and for which month is it low? 
#sales are high during Summer Months (April to July)and 
#End of the Year (October to November)
#and low during January and February


#13) Can you think of the reason behind the high and low values in those months?

#(March to July)
#The spring months of March and April also see increased sales, as consumers are more likely to shop for cars when the weather improves.
#Tax Refunds: Many buyers use their tax refunds to make major purchases like vehicles during these months.
#October to December are typically the strongest months for car sales in the U.S. due to several factors:
#Holiday Sales Events: Many dealerships have promotions around Black Friday and other end-of-year sales events, which boost consumer spending.
#New Model Year Arrivals: Automakers often release new models in the fall, which can attract more buyers.

#January and February typically have lower sales, largely due to the winter weather and the lack of major sales events. Consumer spending is also generally slower after the holidays


#14) Show the plot for time series adjusted for seasonality.

#47)What is the value of alpha?  What does that value signify? #A value of 0.3931 indicates that recent observations are given moderate importance in determining the level component of the time series. A smaller alpha would give more weight to past data.

#48)What is the value of beta? What does that value signify?

#Beta represents the smoothing parameter for the trend in the time series. A value of 0 suggests that the model does not account for any trend in the data. This indicates that the data is assumed to have no trend component, and the model is only capturing the level and seasonality.

#49)What is the value of gamma? What does that value signify?
#A gamma of 0 suggests that the seasonal variations in the data are either very minimal or not considered important for the forecast.

#50)What is the value of initial states for the level, trend, and seasonality? What do these values signify? 
#Initial Level (a) = 16.3203
#This is the starting point or baseline value for the time series, which the model uses to begin its forecasting process.
#Initial Trend (b) = 0.1615
#This represents the initial estimate of the trend in the data. Since beta is 0, this value is less relevant in this model, as no trend is considered.
#Initial Seasonal Components (s1, s2, ..., s12):
#These values represent the initial seasonal factors for each month (12 months total). They capture the seasonal fluctuations in the data, with each value corresponding to a specific month in the seasonal cycle.

#51)What is the value of sigma?  What does the sigma signify?
#A sigma of 0.8045 indicates that the residuals (errors between the forecast and actual values) have a standard deviation of approximately 0.8045, which suggests how much the forecasts are expected to deviate from actual values.

#52)Do a plot of residuals. What does the plot indicate?
# Plot residuals
plot(residuals(forecast_hw), main = "Residuals of Holtz Winter Forecast", ylab = "Residuals", xlab = "Time")
##The residuals plot displays a clear trend, suggesting that the Holt-Winters model might be missing significant elementss.

#53) Do a Histogram plot of residuals. What does the plot indicate?
# Histogram of residuals
hist(residuals(forecast_hw), main = "Histogram of Residuals", xlab = "Residuals", breaks = 15)
#The histogram does not follow a normal distribution, which implies that a transformation of the data or a different modeling approach might be necessary.

#nsdiff is 0
#it means that we do not need to remove seasonality, and the data does not exhibit any strong seasonal pattern.
#ndiff is 1
#it means the series has a trend that needs to be removed by differencing once to make it stationary.

#63)How many differences are needed to make it stationary?
#1

#64)Is a Seasonality component needed?
#nsdiffs() = 0 implies that the time series does not require seasonal differencing, meaning there is no significant seasonality that needs to be addressed through differencing.

#68) Show the AIC, BIC, and Sigma^2 for the possible models


#AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) = 44.77: AIC is used to compare different models; the lower the AIC, the better the model fits the data.
#AICc (corrected AIC) = 46.77: This is the AIC with a correction for small sample sizes.
#BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) = 49.65: BIC is another criterion used to compare models, with a preference for simpler models. Like AIC, lower BIC values are preferred.
#sigma^2 = 0.278 This represents the variance of the residuals (errors), which is a measure of the variability in the time series that the model did not explain. A smaller value of sigma^2 indicates that the model fits the data well.


#69)Based on the above AIC, BIC, and Sigma^2 values, which model will you select? 
#ARIMA(3,1,0)    : 46.77066

#70) What is the final formula for ARIMA with the coefficients? 
#ar1 = -0.4560
#ar2 = -0.1214
#ar3 = 0.4010 These are the estimated coefficients for the autoregressive terms. They represent the relationships between the current value and the previous values of the time series. Specifically:
#The first AR term (ar1) suggests that the value at time 𝑡
#t is negatively influenced by the value at time t−1.
#The second AR term (ar2) indicates a weaker negative influence from the value at time t−2.
#The third AR term (ar3) suggests a positive influence from the value at time t−3.
