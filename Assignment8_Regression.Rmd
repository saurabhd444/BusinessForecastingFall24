#using summary we can see that |p| value is significantly high for Average.Wind.Direction..Day. and Average.Barometric.Pressure..Period. so we have to exclude these features and re implement the model

summary(lm_fit_new)
#New chosen model shows good F-statistic: 686.8 and R Squared better than the previous one 

# Generate residuals vs fitted plot
plot(lm_fit_new, which = 1)
#suggests that the residuals has constant variance and the model fits the data well.

#histogram of residuals
hist(residuals(lm_fit_new), main="Histogram of Residuals", xlab="Residuals", breaks=20)
#The histogram  resemble a bell-shaped curve or normal distribution with a peak at 0 and symmetrical tails on either side. This suggests that the residuals are approximately normally distributed, which is a desirable condition for linear regression.
# Q-Q plot
plot(lm_fit_new, which = 2)
# QQ PLOT shows residuals around the regressions lines which indicates that the residuals are normally distributed which is an assumption of linear regression.
