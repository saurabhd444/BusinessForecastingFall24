#The decomposition output from the STL  analysis presents three main components of the time series:

#Seasonal Component:


#The mean is approximately 1, indicating minimal net seasonal effect over time.
#The interquartile range (IQR) is 1,620,735, indicating significant variability.

#Trend Component:

#Ranges from a minimum of 13,827,436 to a maximum of 27,705,563.
#The mean is about 23,317,044, suggesting a generally increasing trend.
#The IQR is 2,458,557, reflecting considerable variation in the trend.
#Error Component:

#Ranges from a minimum of -2,975,079.3 to a maximum of 3,108,411.7.
#The mean is around -8,246.5, indicating some residual fluctuation that deviates from the trend and seasonality.
#The IQR is 1,287,341, which shows variability in the residuals.
#Overall Summary:
#The output includes specific weights, indicating that all data points were treated equally in the analysis.
#Other parameters (window sizes, degree, jumps) provide insights into the settings used for the decomposition.
#Overall, the analysis shows a clear increasing trend with significant seasonal variation and some residual noise.


# Decomposition Results (using Decomposition)
print(decomp_ts)

#Summarize Decomposition Results

#The data spans from 2001 to 2020 and is presented in quarterly format.
#Values fluctuate over the years, with notable peaks and troughs.
#Seasonal Component
#The seasonal effect is consistent across all quarters, with:
#Q1: -2,346,065
#Q2: -687,270.5
#Q3: 3,484,688.7
#Q4: -451,353.2
#This indicates a strong seasonal peak in Q3.
#Trend Component
#The trend values are calculated for most quarters, showing a general upward trend in early years (2001-2011) followed by a decline:
#Highest trend values occur around 2011.
#By 2020, the trend shows significant drops, especially in Q1 and Q2.
#Random Component
#The random component reflects variability not explained by seasonal or trend components, showing considerable fluctuations:
#Some quarters exhibit large positive or negative values, indicating erratic behavior and noise in the data.
#Summary Statistics
#The decomposition is classified as "additive," meaning the components add together to reconstruct the original series.
#Overall, the decomposition reveals significant seasonal patterns, a generally increasing trend followed by a decline, and notable random fluctuations across the time series.
