#Best model: ARIMA(2,1,2)(0,1,1)[4] however we chose ARIMA(0,1,3)(0,1,1)[4] since it has less number of features with same AIC

#Summary of both ARIMA models
summary(fit)
summary(manual_fit)
#the MAPE value indicates that the model is fairly accurate, with a prediction error of around 5.15%.

#Residual Analysis
Acf(manual_fit$residuals)
#The autocorrelation values  fluctuating around zero with no noticeable patterns and no significant auto-correlated errors which indicates a good fit model
Box.test(residuals(manual_fit), lag=20, type="Ljung")
#Since the p-value is large (0.2724), we conclude that the residuals do not show significant autocorrelation at lags 1 through 20. This is a good sign, as it indicates that the model has captured the underlying temporal dependencies in the data, and the residuals behave like white noise
plot.ts(residuals(manual_fit))
hist(manual_fit$residuals)
#histogram resembles the bell-shaped curve of a normal distribution. This suggests that the model has appropriately captured the underlying patterns in the data.

#We can see the model is fairly accurate as its aligning with the original time series
