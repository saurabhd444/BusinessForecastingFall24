#Summary of HW forecast 
#Smoothing Parameters
#Alpha (0.6045): The smoothing factor for the level. A higher value means the model gives more weight to recent observations.
#Beta (0.0308): The smoothing factor for the trend. A lower value indicates the trend component changes slowly.
#Gamma (0.7574): The smoothing factor for the seasonal component, indicating a strong response to seasonal fluctuations.
#Coefficients
#a (15544660.1): The baseline level of the series.
#b (-197278.2): The estimated trend component, suggesting a slight decline.
#s1 to s4: Seasonal adjustments for each quarter. These values reflect the expected seasonal variation.
#Error Measures
#ME (Mean Error): -271203.4 indicates that forecasts tend to underestimate actual values.
#RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): 1782227 shows the average magnitude of the forecast errors.
#MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 1377063 provides another measure of forecast accuracy.
#MPE (Mean Percentage Error): -1.63% shows a slight negative bias in forecasts.
#MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): 6.48% indicates reasonable forecasting accuracy.
#MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error): 0.7382 suggests that the model performs better than a naive forecasting method.
#ACF1 (Autocorrelation of the forecast errors): 0.2257 indicates some correlation between errors, suggesting room for improvement.
#Forecasts
#The table provides quarterly forecasts for 2021 to 2023, including:

#Point Forecast: The predicted value for each quarter.
#Confidence Intervals:
#Lo 80 / Hi 80: 80% confidence intervals.
#Lo 95 / Hi 95: 95% confidence intervals.
#Interpretation of Forecasts
#The forecasts show a general trend of fluctuating values over the quarters, with some quarters experiencing significant increases (e.g., Q3 2021: 17,092,269) and others a decrease (e.g., Q1 2023: 9,111,333).
#The confidence intervals provide a range in which the actual values are expected to fall, which helps in assessing the uncertainty of #the forecasts.
#Conclusion
#Overall, the Holt-Winters model provides a structured approach to forecasting winter-related data with a focus on seasonality and trends. The results indicate a reasonable level of accuracy, though there are slight biases and areas for improvement in the model.
