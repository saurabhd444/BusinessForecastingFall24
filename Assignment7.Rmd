#Summary of initial Analysis of time series
# The high initial ACF values indicate some short-term dependence between adjacent data points.
#Lack of Strong Seasonal Pattern: No strong periodic peaks were observed, meaning seasonality is not significant
# Cyclical Pattern: The switch to negative correlations suggests potential cycles in the data without a long-term trend.


#Since weâ€™re working with monthly data (positive values), Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) is a robust measure as it is scaled, making it more interpretable and comparable across different methods.


# Decompose the series using STL decomposition
insurance_decomp <- stl(ts, s.window = "periodic")
plot(insurance_decomp)
de_forecast <- forecast(insurance_decomp, h = 12)

#The Decomposition model has the lowest MASE (0.3323), indicating it performs better than the naive forecast. The ETS model (0.4471) also shows good performance, while the Holt-Winters (0.5238) and Mean (0.5699) models perform relatively poorer.

#Overall Conclusion and model Rankings

# 1) Use the Decomposition model for future forecasting, as it has the best overall performance across the key accuracy metrics.
# 2)The ETS model may also be utilized as a reliable alternative, particularly if seasonality is a significant factor in the data.
# 3)The Holt-Winters and 
# 4)Mean models should be revisited or refined, as their performance indicates they are less reliable for accurate forecasting for this insurance dataset
